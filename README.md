# portfolio

List of technologies were YouTube, MDN, and W3schools

My users would be employers coming to see what I have to offer as a software engineer checking in on what I have acomplished my experience and getting an idea on my creativity and first hand work by navigating through my portfolio.

My unsolved problems have to be making it to where you dont have to scroll on my home page I had trouble getting my links to work on my page and had a lot of difficulty getting the css remotley to how i wanted it its not close to how I want it to be but its fine for now
